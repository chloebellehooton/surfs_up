# Surf's Up

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
I want to open a Surf & Shake shop. When I reached out to an investor, he let me know he was concerned about the weather so he asked me to run some analytics on a weather dataset of the area. 

W. Avy, the investor, liked my analysis, but he wanted more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. He tasked me to get temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. This will help inform if this shop is a viable business plan. 


## Results: 

### June Weather
- For June the minimum temperature is 63
- 50% of the month has a temperature over 75

## Summary: 

Not surprisingly, the weather for Hawaii is nearly perfect year round. With a mean temperature of 75 in June and 71 in December, the temperature aspect of the weather is unlikely to make an impact on the sales of ice cream. This seems like a viable business year round.

I would like to explore the effects of other weather aspects such as rain or wind. If there is lots of rain or wind then customers might stay inside or be afraid of their ice cream getting destroyed by the elements. 

This could be a factor with the surf rental part of the business as well. We should also look into the tides and current data to make sure there aren't off seasons where surfers will be avoiding the beach due to bad waves or safety risks.
